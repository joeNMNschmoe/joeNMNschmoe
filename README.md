## Hi there its Joe SchmoeðŸ‘‹

##  I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Graphic Information Technology at Arizona State University. I haven't decided on my main focus yet, but I know I need to make that grown-up decision soon. Right now, Iâ€™m taking a class called GIT215, which focuses on HTML5 and CSS programming. As part of this class, Iâ€™m using GitHub, and Iâ€™d love to learn more about its applications beyond what Iâ€™m doing in the course. Thanks for taking the time to read my little bio!
